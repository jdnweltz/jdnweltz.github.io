work:
- position: Applied Scientist, Prime Machine Learning Team
  company_name: Amazon
  company_url: ''
  #company_logo: org-x
  location: New York
  date_start: '2022-06-01'
  date_end: '2023-04-28'
  summary: |2-
    *	Produced a series of reinforcement learning algorithms in Python to efficiently identify the optimal characteristics of prime membership advertisements through strategic sequential testing
    *	Adapted these models to complex data settings, including sparse signals and heteroskedastic noise
    *	Created realistic simulation structures to test best-advertisement identification algorithms (“best-arm identification” in the multi-armed bandit literature) against A/B testing and other competitors in high-dimensional data contexts

  summary: |2-
      * Designed a  reinforcement learning algorithm to better select advertisements sourced by a variety of machine learning algorithms using query features and partially observed customer behavior signals
      * Implemented the infrastructure for evaluating the advantages of modifications to advertisement sourcing algorithms on downstream outcomes in Spark
      * Ran off-line experiments testing the utility of my algorithm over a week of Amazon search query traffic and found that it was consistently capturing more than 3% of the high-quality ads missed by the current method

## About Me

I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Santa Fe Institute, where I work on statistical inference for complex network sampling techniques. I recently completed my Ph.D. at Duke University advised by [Alexander Volfovsky](https://volfovsky.github.io/) and [Eric Laber](https://www.laber-labs.com/). My dissertation research focused on creating methods for the study and assistance of hard-to-reach populations.
